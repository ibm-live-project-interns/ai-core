Instead, the current code does the opposite: it skips inactive\nelements and processes active ones.\n\nCompare the non-catchall activate callback, which is correct:\n\n  nft_mapelem_activate():\n    if (nft_set_elem_active(ext, iter-\u003egenmask))\n        return 0;   /* skip active, process inactive */\n\nWith the buggy catchall version:\n\n  nft_map_catchall_activate():\n    if (!nft_set_elem_active(ext, genmask))\n        continue;   /* skip inactive, process active */\n\nThe consequence is that when a DELSET operation is aborted,\nnft_setelem_data_activate() is never called for the catchall element.\nFor NFT_GOTO verdict elements, this means nft_data_hold() is never\ncalled to restore the chain-\u003euse reference count.

The verifyRelPath function used strings.HasPrefix() to verify that requested paths fall within the configured storage directory. This check was insufficient because it validated only the path prefix without requiring a path separator, allowing access to sibling directories with similar names. Also, the adapter verified that resolved paths stayed within the adapter's base path, but did not verify that object identifiers stayed within their designated storage namespace. This allowed attackers to use path traversal sequences in the object identifier to access files in other namespaces. Fixed in version v1.77.0.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Fix SVE writes on !SME systems\n\nWhen SVE is supported but SME is not supported, a ptrace write to the\nNT_ARM_SVE regset can place the tracee into an invalid state where\n(non-streaming) SVE register data is stored in FP_STATE_SVE format but\nTIF_SVE is clear. This can result in a later warning from\nfpsimd_restore_current_state(), e.g.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 7214 at arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c:383 fpsimd_restore_current_state+0x50c/0x748\n\nWhen this happens, fpsimd_restore_current_state() will set TIF_SVE,\nplacing the task into the correct state. This occurs before any other\ncheck of TIF_SVE can possibly occur, as other checks of TIF_SVE only\nhappen while the FPSIMD/SVE/SME state is live. Thus, aside from the\nwarning, there is no functional issue.\n\nThis bug was introduced during rework to error handling in commit:\n\n  9f8bf718f2923 (\"arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Gracefully handle errors\")\n\n... where the setting of TIF_SVE was moved into a block which is only\nexecuted when system_supports_sme() is true.\n\nFix this by removing the system_supports_sme() check. This ensures that\nTIF_SVE is set for (SVE-formatted) writes to NT_ARM_SVE, at the cost of\nunconditionally manipulating the tracee's saved svcr value. The\nmanipulation of svcr is benign and inexpensive, and we already do\nsimilar elsewhere (e.g. during signal handling), so I don't think it's\nworth guarding this with system_supports_sme() checks.\n\nAside from the above, there is no functional change. The 'type' argument\nto sve_set_common() is only set to ARM64_VEC_SME (in ssve_set())) when\nsystem_supports_sme(), so the ARM64_VEC_SME case in the switch statement\nis still unreachable when !system_supports_sme(). When\nCONFIG_ARM64_SME=n, the only caller of sve_set_common() is sve_set(),\nand the compiler can constant-fold for the case where type is\nARM64_VEC_SVE, removing the logic for other cases.",

In this case, the\ncommand sequence is currently:\n\n- SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT\n- SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP (T1_INIT)\n- SCTP_CMD_TIMER_START (T1_COOKIE)\n- SCTP_CMD_NEW_STATE (COOKIE_ECHOED)\n- SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY\n- SCTP_CMD_GEN_COOKIE_ECHO\n\nIf SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY fails, asoc-\u003eshkey remains NULL, while\nasoc-\u003epeer.auth_capable and asoc-\u003epeer.peer_chunks have already been set by\nSCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT. This allows a DATA chunk with auth = 1 and shkey = NULL\nto be queued by sctp_datamsg_from_user().\n\nSince command interpretation stops on failure, no COOKIE_ECHO should been\nsent via SCTP_CMD_GEN_COOKIE_ECHO. However, the T1_COOKIE timer has already\nbeen started, and it may enqueue a COOKIE_ECHO into the outqueue later. As\na result, the DATA chunk can be transmitted together with the COOKIE_ECHO\nin sctp_outq_flush_data(), leading to the observed issue.\n\nSimilar to the other places where it calls sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key()\nright after sctp_process_init(), this patch moves the SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY\nimmediately after SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT, before stopping T1_INIT and starting\nT1_COOKIE. This ensures that if shared key generation fails, authenticated\nDATA cannot be sent. It also allows the T1_INIT timer to retransmit INIT,\ngiving the client another chance to process INIT_ACK and retry key setup.",

Since a wiphy work can only run under wiphy lock\nprotection, a race condition happens in below scenario:\n\n1. a management frame is queued for transmission.\n2. ath12k_mac_op_flush() gets called to flush pending frames associated\n   with the hardware (i.e, vif being NULL). Then in ath12k_mac_flush()\n   the process waits for the transmission done.\n3. Since wiphy lock has been taken by the flush process, the transmission\n   work item has no chance to run, hence the dead lock.\n\n\u003eFrom user view, this dead lock results in below issue:\n\n wlp8s0: authenticate with xxxxxx (local address=xxxxxx)\n wlp8s0: send auth to xxxxxx (try 1/3)\n wlp8s0: authenticate with xxxxxx (local address=xxxxxx)\n wlp8s0: send auth to xxxxxx (try 1/3)\n wlp8s0: authenticated\n wlp8s0: associate with xxxxxx (try 1/3)\n wlp8s0: aborting association with xxxxxx by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)\n ath12k_pci 0000:08:00.0: failed to flush mgmt transmit queue, mgmt pkts pending 1\n\nThe dead lock can be avoided by invoking wiphy_work_flush() to proactively\nrun the queued work item.

The 'ZERO' subreq that clears the tail\nhappens after we unlock the folio, allowing the application to see the\nuncleared tail through mmap.\n\nThe problem is that netfs_read_unlock_folios() will unlock a folio in which\nthe amount of read results collected hits EOF position - but the ZERO\nsubreq lies beyond that and so happens after.\n\nFix this by changing the end check to always be the end of the folio and\nnever the end of the file.\n\nIn the future, I should look at clearing to the end of the folio here rather\nthan adding a ZERO subreq to do this.  On the other hand, the ZERO subreq can\nrun in parallel with an async READ subreq.  Further, the ZERO subreq may still\nbe necessary to, say, handle extents in a ceph file that don't have any\nbacking store and are thus implicitly all zeros.\n\nThis can be reproduced by creating a file, the size of which doesn't align\nto a page boundary, e.g. 24998 (0x5fb2) bytes and then doing something\nlike:\n\n    xfs_io -c \"mmap -r 0 0x6000\" -c \"madvise -d 0 0x6000\" \\\n           -c \"mread -v 0 0x6000\" /xfstest.test/x\n\nThe last 0x4e bytes should all be 00, but if the tail hasn't been cleared\nyet, you may see rubbish there.  This can be reproduced with kafs by\nmodifying the kernel to disable the call to netfs_read_subreq_progress()\nand to stop afs_issue_read() from doing the async call for NETFS_READAHEAD.\nReproduction can be made easier by inserting an mdelay(100) in\nnetfs_issue_read() for the ZERO-subreq case.\n\nAFS and CIFS are normally unlikely to show this as they dispatch READ ops\nasynchronously, which allows the ZERO-subreq to finish first.  9P's READ op is\ncompletely synchronous, so the ZERO-subreq will always happen after.  It isn't\nseen all the time, though, because the collection may be done in a worker\nthread.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, test_run: Subtract size of xdp_frame from allowed metadata size\n\nThe xdp_frame structure takes up part of the XDP frame headroom,\nlimiting the size of the metadata. However, in bpf_test_run, we don't\ntake this into account, which makes it possible for userspace to supply\na metadata size that is too large (taking up the entire headroom).\n\nIf userspace supplies such a large metadata size in live packet mode,\nthe xdp_update_frame_from_buff() call in xdp_test_run_init_page() call\nwill fail, after which packet transmission proceeds with an\nuninitialised frame structure, leading to the usual Bad Stuff.\n\nThe commit in the Fixes tag fixed a related bug where the second check\nin xdp_update_frame_from_buff() could fail, but did not add any\nadditional constraints on the metadata size. Complete the fix by adding\nan additional check on the metadata size. Reorder the checks slightly to\nmake the logic clearer and add a comment.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix segmentation of forwarding fraglist GRO\n\nThis patch enhances GSO segment handling by properly checking\nthe SKB_GSO_DODGY flag for frag_list GSO packets, addressing\nlow throughput issues observed when a station accesses IPv4\nservers via hotspots with an IPv6-only upstream interface.\n\nSpecifically, it fixes a bug in GSO segmentation when forwarding\nGRO packets containing a frag_list. The function skb_segment_list\ncannot correctly process GRO skbs that have been converted by XLAT,\nsince XLAT only translates the header of the head skb. Consequently,\nskbs in the frag_list may remain untranslated, resulting in protocol\ninconsistencies and reduced throughput.\n\nTo address this, the patch explicitly sets the SKB_GSO_DODGY flag\nfor GSO packets in XLAT's IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation helpers\n(bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6 and bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4). This marks GSO\npackets as potentially modified after protocol translation. As a\nresult, GSO segmentation will avoid using skb_segment_list and\ninstead falls back to skb_segment for packets with the SKB_GSO_DODGY\nflag. This ensures that only safe and fully translated frag_list\npackets are processed by skb_segment_list, resolving protocol\ninconsistencies and improving throughput when forwarding GRO packets\nconverted by XLAT.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: do not strictly require dirty metadata threshold for metadata writepages\n\n[BUG]\nThere is an internal report that over 1000 processes are\nwaiting at the io_schedule_timeout() of balance_dirty_pages(), causing\na system hang and trigger a kernel coredump.\n\nThe kernel is v6.4 kernel based, but the root problem still applies to\nany upstream kernel before v6.18.\n\n[CAUSE]\nFrom Jan Kara for his wisdom on the dirty page balance behavior first.\n\n  This cgroup dirty limit was what was actually playing the role here\n  because the cgroup had only a small amount of memory and so the dirty\n  limit for it was something like 16MB.\n\n  Dirty throttling is responsible for enforcing that nobody can dirty\n  (significantly) more dirty memory than there's dirty limit. Thus when\n  a task is dirtying pages it periodically enters into balance_dirty_pages()\n  and we let it sleep there to slow down the dirtying.\n\n  When the system is over dirty limit already (either globally or within\n  a cgroup of the running task), we will not let the task exit from\n  balance_dirty_pages() until the number of dirty pages drops below the\n  limit.\n\n  So in this particular case, as I already mentioned, there was a cgroup\n  with relatively small amount of memory and as a result with dirty limit\n  set at 16MB. A task from that cgroup has dirtied about 28MB worth of\n  pages in btrfs btree inode and these were practically the only dirty\n  pages in that cgroup.\n\nSo that means the only way to reduce the dirty pages of that cgroup is\nto writeback the dirty pages of btrfs btree inode, and only after that\nthose processes can exit balance_dirty_pages().\n\nNow back to the btrfs part, btree_writepages() is responsible for\nwriting back dirty btree inode pages.\n\nThe problem here is, there is a btrfs internal threshold that if the\nbtree inode's dirty bytes are below the 32M threshold, it will not\ndo any writeback.\n\nThis behavior is to batch as much metadata as possible so we won't write\nback those tree blocks and then later re-COW them again for another\nmodification.\n\nThis internal 32MiB is higher than the existing dirty page size (28MiB),\nmeaning no writeback will happen, causing a deadlock between btrfs and\ncgroup:\n\n- Btrfs doesn't want to write back btree inode until more dirty pages\n\n- Cgroup/MM doesn't want more dirty pages for btrfs btree inode\n  Thus any process touching that btree inode is put into sleep until\n  the number of dirty pages is reduced.\n\nThanks Jan Kara a lot for the analysis of the root cause.\n\n[ENHANCEMENT]\nSince kernel commit b55102826d7d (\"btrfs: set AS_KERNEL_FILE on the\nbtree_inode\"), btrfs btree inode pages will only be charged to the root\ncgroup which should have a much larger limit than btrfs' 32MiB\nthreshold.\nSo it should not affect newer kernels.\n\nBut for all current LTS kernels, they are all affected by this problem,\nand backporting the whole AS_KERNEL_FILE may not be a good idea.\n\nEven for newer kernels I still think it's a good idea to get\nrid of the internal threshold at btree_writepages(), since for most cases\ncgroup/MM has a better view of full system memory usage than btrfs' fixed\nthreshold.\n\nFor internal callers using btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() since that\nfunction is already doing internal threshold check, we don't need to\nbother them.\n\nBut for external callers of btree_writepages(), just respect their\nrequests and write back whatever they want, ignoring the internal\nbtrfs threshold to avoid such deadlock on btree inode dirty page\nbalancing.",

It use to be possible to test if a\ntask is a user task or not by simply checking the task_struct mm field. If\nit was non NULL, it was a user task and if not it was a kernel task.\n\nBut things have changed over time, and some kernel tasks now have their\nown mm field.\n\nAn idea was made to instead test PF_KTHREAD and two functions were used to\nwrap this check in case it became more complex to test if a task was a\nuser task or not[1]. But this was rejected and the C code simply checked\nthe PF_KTHREAD directly.\n\nIt was later found that not all kernel threads set PF_KTHREAD. The io-uring\nhelpers instead set PF_USER_WORKER and this needed to be added as well.\n\nBut checking the flags is still not enough. There's a very small window\nwhen a task exits that it frees its mm field and it is set back to NULL.\nIf perf were to trigger at this moment, the flags test would say its a\nuser space task but when perf would read the mm field it would crash with\nat NULL pointer dereference.\n\nNow there are flags that can be used to test if a task is exiting, but\nthey are set in areas that perf may still want to profile the user space\ntask (to see where it exited). The only real test is to check both the\nflags and the mm field.\n\nInstead of making this modification in every location, create a new\nis_user_task() helper function that does all the tests needed to know if\nit is safe to read the user space memory or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250425204120.639530125@goodmis.org/",

It uses xa_cmpxchg_irq to erase the swap entry, but it\ngets the entry order before that using xa_get_order without lock\nprotection, and it may get an outdated order value if the entry is split\nor changed in other ways after the xa_get_order and before the\nxa_cmpxchg_irq.\n\nAnd besides, the order could grow and be larger than expected, and cause\ntruncation to erase data beyond the end border.  For example, if the\ntarget entry and following entries are swapped in or freed, then a large\nfolio was added in place and swapped out, using the same entry, the\nxa_cmpxchg_irq will still succeed, it's very unlikely to happen though.\n\nTo fix that, open code the Xarray cmpxchg and put the order retrieval and\nvalue checking in the same critical section.  Also, ensure the order won't\nexceed the end border, skip it if the entry goes across the border.\n\nSkipping large swap entries crosses the end border is safe here.  Shmem\ntruncate iterates the range twice, in the first iteration,\nfind_lock_entries already filtered such entries, and shmem will swapin the\nentries that cross the end border and partially truncate the folio (split\nthe folio or at least zero part of it).

While under normal protocol conditions (MTU 3080\nbytes, BAT buffer 3584 bytes),\na single packet should not require additional\nfragments, the kernel should not blindly trust firmware behavior.\nMalicious, buggy, or compromised firmware could potentially craft packets\nwith more fragments than the kernel expects.\n\nFix this by adding a bounds check before calling skb_add_rx_frag() to\nensure nr_frags does not exceed MAX_SKB_FRAGS.\n\nThe check must be performed before unmapping to avoid a page leak\nand double DMA unmap during device teardown.",

At this point,\nnetdev_run_todo() can proceed (since linkwatch_sync_dev() sees an\nempty list and returns without blocking), wait for the refcount to\nbecome 1 via netdev_wait_allrefs_any(), and then free the device\nvia kobject_put().\n\nThis creates a use-after-free when __linkwatch_run_queue() tries to\ncall netdev_unlock_ops() on the already-freed device.\n\nNote that adding netdev_lock_ops()/netdev_unlock_ops() pair in\nnetdev_run_todo() before kobject_put() would not work, because\nnetdev_lock_ops() is conditional - it only locks when\nnetdev_need_ops_lock() returns true. If the device doesn't require\nops_lock, linkwatch won't hold any lock, and netdev_run_todo()\nacquiring the lock won't provide synchronization.\n\nFix this by moving __dev_put() from linkwatch_do_dev() to its\ncallers.

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: Don't clobber irqfd routing type when deassigning irqfd\n\nWhen deassigning a KVM_IRQFD, don't clobber the irqfd's copy of the IRQ's\nrouting entry as doing so breaks kvm_arch_irq_bypass_del_producer() on x86\nand arm64, which explicitly look for KVM_IRQ_ROUTING_MSI.  Instead, to\nhandle a concurrent routing update, verify that the irqfd is still active\nbefore consuming the routing information.  As evidenced by the x86 and\narm64 bugs, and another bug in kvm_arch_update_irqfd_routing() (see below),\nclobbering the entry type without notifying arch code is surprising and\nerror prone.\n\nAs a bonus, checking that the irqfd is active provides a convenient\nlocation for documenting _why_ KVM must not consume the routing entry for\nan irqfd that is in the process of being deassigned: once the irqfd is\ndeleted from the list (which happens *before* the eventfd is detached), it\nwill no longer receive updates via kvm_irq_routing_update(), and so KVM\ncould deliver an event using stale routing information (relative to\nKVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING returning to userspace).\n\nAs an even better bonus, explicitly checking for the irqfd being active\nfixes a similar bug to the one the clobbering is trying to prevent: if an\nirqfd is deactivated, and then its routing is changed,\nkvm_irq_routing_update() won't invoke kvm_arch_update_irqfd_routing()\n(because the irqfd isn't in the list).  And so if the irqfd is in bypass\nmode, IRQs will continue to be posted using the old routing information.\n\nAs for kvm_arch_irq_bypass_del_producer(), clobbering the routing type\nresults in KVM incorrectly keeping the IRQ in bypass mode, which is\nespecially problematic on AMD as KVM tracks IRQs that are being posted to\na vCPU in a list whose lifetime is tied to the irqfd.\n\nWithout the help of KASAN to detect use-after-free, the most common\nsympton on AMD is a NULL pointer deref in amd_iommu_update_ga() due to\nthe memory for irqfd structure being re-allocated and zeroed, resulting\nin irqfd-\u003eirq_bypass_data being NULL when read by\navic_update_iommu_vcpu_affinity():\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 40cf2b9067 P4D 40cf2b9067 PUD 408362a067 PMD 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP\n  CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 40383 Comm: vfio_irq_test\n  Tainted: G     U  W  O        6.19.0-smp--5dddc257e6b2-irqfd #31 NONE\n  Tainted: [U]=USER, [W]=WARN, [O]=OOT_MODULE\n  Hardware name: Google, Inc.

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: Fix ECMP sibling count mismatch when clearing RTF_ADDRCONF\n\nsyzbot reported a kernel BUG in fib6_add_rt2node() when adding an IPv6\nroute. [0]\n\nCommit f72514b3c569 (\"ipv6: clear RA flags when adding a static\nroute\") introduced logic to clear RTF_ADDRCONF from existing routes\nwhen a static route with the same nexthop is added. However, this\ncauses a problem when the existing route has a gateway.\n\nWhen RTF_ADDRCONF is cleared from a route that has a gateway, that\nroute becomes eligible for ECMP, i.e. rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() returns\ntrue. The issue is that this route was never added to the\nfib6_siblings list.\n\nThis leads to a mismatch between the following counts:\n\n- The sibling count computed by iterating fib6_next chain, which\n  includes the newly ECMP-eligible route\n\n- The actual siblings in fib6_siblings list, which does not include\n  that route\n\nWhen a subsequent ECMP route is added, fib6_add_rt2node() hits\nBUG_ON(sibling-\u003efib6_nsiblings != rt-\u003efib6_nsiblings) because the\ncounts don't match.\n\nFix this by only clearing RTF_ADDRCONF when the existing route does\nnot have a gateway. Routes without a gateway cannot qualify for ECMP\nanyway (rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() requires fib_nh_gw_family), so clearing\nRTF_ADDRCONF on them is safe and matches the original intent of the\ncommit.\n\n[0]:\nkernel BUG at net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:1217!\nOops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6010 Comm: syz.0.17 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 10/25/2025\nRIP: 0010:fib6_add_rt2node+0x3433/0x3470 net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:1217\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n fib6_add+0x8da/0x18a0 net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:1532\n __ip6_ins_rt net/ipv6/route.c:1351 [inline]\n ip6_route_add+0xde/0x1b0 net/ipv6/route.c:3946\n ipv6_route_ioctl+0x35c/0x480 net/ipv6/route.c:4571\n inet6_ioctl+0x219/0x280 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:577\n sock_do_ioctl+0xdc/0x300 net/socket.c:1245\n sock_ioctl+0x576/0x790 net/socket.c:1366\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:597 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xfc/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:583\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa/0xf80 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f",

When the\ndevice reports zero interfaces (either due to hardware configuration\nor firmware issues), kcalloc(0, ...) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR (0x10)\ninstead of NULL.\n\nLater in dpaa2_switch_probe(), the NAPI initialization unconditionally\naccesses ethsw-\u003eports[0]-\u003enetdev, which attempts to dereference\nZERO_SIZE_PTR (address 0x10), resulting in a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a check to ensure num_ifs is greater than zero after retrieving\ndevice attributes. This prevents the zero-sized allocations and\nsubsequent invalid pointer dereference.",

Therefore, if the first evaluation of a \nplaceholder again contains a placeholder, this second placeholder was \nrendered. This allows the rendering of placeholders controlled by the \nticket buyer, and therefore the exploitation of the first issue as a \nticket buyer. Luckily, the only buyer-controlled placeholder available \nin pretix by default (that is not validated in a way that prevents the \nissue) is {invoice_company}, which is very unusual (but not\n impossible) to be contained in an email subject template.

      "description": "Use After Free vulnerability in Apache Arrow C++.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Arrow C++ from 15.0.0 through 23.0.0. It can be triggered when reading an Arrow IPC file (but not an IPC stream) with pre-buffering enabled, if the IPC file contains data with variadic buffers (such as Binary View and String View data). Depending on the number of variadic buffers in a record batch column and on the temporal sequence of multi-threaded IO, a write to a dangling pointer could occur. The value (a `std::shared_ptr\u003cBuffer\u003e` object) that is written to the dangling pointer is not under direct control of the attacker.\n\nPre-buffering is disabled by default but can be enabled using a specific C++ API call (`RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`). The functionality is not exposed in language bindings (Python, Ruby, C GLib), so these bindings are not vulnerable.\n\nThe most likely consequence of this issue would be random crashes or memory corruption when reading specific kinds of IPC files. If the application allows ingesting IPC files from untrusted sources, this could plausibly be exploited for denial of service. Inducing more targeted kinds of misbehavior (such as confidential data extraction from the running process) depends on memory allocation and multi-threaded IO temporal patterns that are unlikely to be easily controlled by an attacker.\n\nAdvice for users of Arrow C++:\n\n1. check whether you enable pre-buffering on the IPC file reader (using `RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`)\n\n2. if so, either disable pre-buffering (which may have adverse performance consequences), or switch to Arrow 23.0.1 which is not vulnerable",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/pm: Disable MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset\n\nDuring Mode 1 reset, the ASIC undergoes a reset cycle and becomes\ntemporarily inaccessible via PCIe. Any attempt to access MMIO registers\nduring this window (e.g., from interrupt handlers or other driver threads)\ncan result in uncompleted PCIe transactions, leading to NMI panics or\nsystem hangs.\n\nTo prevent this, set the `no_hw_access` flag to true immediately after\ntriggering the reset. This signals other driver components to skip\nregister accesses while the device is offline.\n\nA memory barrier `smp_mb()` is added to ensure the flag update is\nglobally visible to all cores before the driver enters the sleep/wait\nstate.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 7edb503fe4b6d67f47d8bb0dfafb8e699bb0f8a4)",

      "description": "The BSV Blockchain SDK is a unified TypeScript SDK for developing scalable apps on the BSV Blockchain. Prior to version 2.0.0, a cryptographic vulnerability in the TypeScript SDK's BRC-104 authentication implementation caused incorrect signature data preparation, resulting in signature incompatibility between SDK implementations and potential authentication bypass scenarios. The vulnerability was located in the `Peer.ts` file of the TypeScript SDK, specifically in the `processInitialRequest` and `processInitialResponse` methods where signature data is prepared for BRC-104 mutual authentication. The TypeScript SDK incorrectly prepared signature data by concatenating base64-encoded nonce strings (`message.initialNonce + sessionNonce`) then decoding the concatenated base64 string (`base64ToBytes(concatenatedString)`). This produced ~32-34 bytes of signature data instead of the correct 64 bytes. BRC-104 authentication relies on cryptographic signatures to establish mutual trust between peers. When signature data preparation is incorrect, signatures generated by the TypeScript SDK don't match those expected by Go/Python SDKs; cross-implementation authentication fails; and an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass authentication checks. The fix in version 2.0.0 ensures all SDKs now produce identical cryptographic signatures, restoring proper mutual authentication across implementations.",

If an attacker can reach the webhook endpoint, they may be able to send forged updates that are processed as if they came from Telegram. Depending on enabled commands/tools and configuration, this could lead to unintended bot actions. Note: Telegram webhook mode is not enabled by default. It is enabled only when `channels.telegram.webhookUrl` is configured. This issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.1.",

Users should upgrade to version 3.3.10 to receive a patch. Those who do not have IPs that expose sensitive data without authentication (typically because they do not host Indico on AWS) are not affected. Only event organizers can access endpoints where SSRF could be used to actually see the data returned by such a request. For those who trust their event organizers, the risk is also very limited. For additional security, both before and after patching, one may also use the common proxy-related environment variables (in particular `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`) to force outgoing requests to go through a proxy that limits requests in whatever way you deem useful/necessary. These environment variables would need to be set both on the indico-uwsgi and indico-celery services.",

      "description": "strongMan is a management interface for strongSwan, an OpenSource IPsec-based VPN. When storing credentials in the database (private keys, EAP secrets), strongMan encrypts the corresponding database fields. So far it used AES in CTR mode with a global database key. Together with an initialization vector (IV), a key stream is generated to encrypt the data in the database fields. But because strongMan did not generate individual IVs, every database field was encrypted using the same key stream. An attacker that has access to the database can use this to recover the encrypted credentials. In particular, because certificates, which have to be considered public information, are also encrypted using the same mechanism, an attacker can directly recover a large chunk of the key stream, which allows them to decrypt basically all other secrets especially ECDSA private keys and EAP secrets, which are usually a lot shorter. Version 0.2.0 fixes the issue by switching to AES-GCM-SIV encryption with a random nonce and an individually derived encryption key, using HKDF, for each encrypted value. Database migrations are provided to automatically re-encrypt all credentials.",

      "description": "Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl, a free, open-source game server management panel. Prior to version 1.12.1, a missing authorization check in multiple controllers allows any user with access to a node secret token to fetch information about any server on a Pterodactyl instance, even if that server is associated with a different node. This issue stems from missing logic to verify that the node requesting server data is the same node that the server is associated with. Any authenticated Wings node can retrieve server installation scripts (potentially containing secret values) and manipulate the installation status of servers belonging to other nodes. Wings nodes may also manipulate the transfer status of servers belonging to other nodes. This vulnerability requires a user to acquire a secret access token for a node. Unless a user gains access to a Wings secret access token they would not be able to access any of these vulnerable endpoints, as every endpoint requires a valid node access token. A single compromised Wings node daemon token (stored in plaintext at `/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml`) grants access to sensitive configuration data of every server on the panel, rather than only to servers that the node has access to. An attacker can use this information to move laterally through the system, send excessive notifications, destroy server data on other nodes, and otherwise exfiltrate secrets that they should not have access to with only a node token. Additionally, triggering a false transfer success causes the panel to delete the server from the source node, resulting in permanent data loss. Users should upgrade to version 1.12.1 to receive a fix.",

      "description": "Trivy Action runs Trivy as GitHub action to scan a Docker container image for vulnerabilities. A command injection vulnerability exists in `aquasecurity/trivy-action` versions 0.31.0 through 0.33.1 due to improper handling of action inputs when exporting environment variables. The action writes `export VAR=\u003cinput\u003e` lines to `trivy_envs.txt` based on user-supplied inputs and subsequently sources this file in `entrypoint.sh`. Because input values are written without appropriate shell escaping, attacker-controlled input containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `$(...)`, backticks, or other command substitution syntax) may be evaluated during the sourcing process. This can result in arbitrary command execution within the GitHub Actions runner context. Version 0.34.0 contains a patch for this issue. The vulnerability is exploitable when a consuming workflow passes attacker-controlled data into any action input that is written to `trivy_envs.txt`. Access to user input is required by the malicious actor. Workflows that do not pass attacker-controlled data into `trivy-action` inputs, workflows that upgrade to a patched version that properly escapes shell values or eliminates the `source ./trivy_envs.txt` pattern, and workflows where user input is not accessible are not affected.",

      "description": "soroban-sdk is a Rust SDK for Soroban contracts. Prior to versions 22.0.10, 23.5.2, and 25.1.1, the `#[contractimpl]` macro contains a bug in how it wires up function calls. `#[contractimpl]` generates code that uses `MyContract::value()` style calls even when it's processing the trait version. This means if an inherent function is also defined with the same name, the inherent function gets called instead of the trait function. This means the Wasm-exported entry point silently calls the wrong function when two conditions are met simultaneously: First, an `impl Trait for MyContract` block is defined with one or more functions, with `#[contractimpl]` applied. Second, an `impl MyContract` block is defined with one or more identically named functions, without `#[contractimpl]` applied. If the trait version contains important security checks, such as verifying the caller is authorized, that the inherent version does not, those checks are bypassed. Anyone interacting with the contract through its public interface will call the wrong function. The problem is patched in `soroban-sdk-macros` versions 22.0.10, 23.5.2, and 25.1.1. The fix changes the generated call from `\u003cType\u003e::func()` to `\u003cType as Trait\u003e::func()` when processing trait implementations, ensuring Rust resolves to the trait associated function regardless of whether an inherent function with the same name exists. Users should upgrade to `soroban-sdk-macros` 22.0.10, 23.5.2, or 25.1.1 and recompile their contracts. If upgrading is not immediately possible, contract developers can avoid the issue by ensuring that no inherent associated function on the contract type shares a name with any function in the trait implementation. Renaming or removing the conflicting inherent function eliminates the ambiguity and causes the macro-generated code to correctly resolve to the trait function.",

An issue was discovered in `httpsig-hyper` prior to version 0.0.23 where Digest header verification could incorrectly succeed due to misuse of Rust's `matches!` macro. Specifically, the comparison `if matches!(digest, _expected_digest)` treated `_expected_digest` as a pattern binding rather than a value comparison, resulting in unconditional success of the match expression. As a consequence, digest verification could incorrectly return success even when the computed digest did not match the expected value. Applications relying on Digest verification as part of HTTP message signature validation may therefore fail to detect message body modification. The severity depends on how the library is integrated and whether additional signature validation layers are enforced. This issue has been fixed in `httpsig-hyper` 0.0.23. The fix replaces the incorrect `matches!` usage with proper value comparison and additionally introduces constant-time comparison for digest verification as defense-in-depth. Regression tests have also been added to prevent reintroduction of this issue. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to the patched version. There is no reliable workaround without upgrading. Users who cannot immediately upgrade should avoid relying solely on Digest verification for message integrity and ensure that full HTTP message signature verification is enforced at the application layer.",

Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Gateway tool accepted a tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` without sufficient restrictions, which could cause the OpenClaw host to attempt outbound WebSocket connections to user-specified targets. This requires the ability to invoke tools that accept `gatewayUrl` overrides (directly or indirectly). In typical setups this is limited to authenticated operators, trusted automation, or environments where tool calls are exposed to non-operators. In other words, this is not a drive-by issue for arbitrary internet users unless a deployment explicitly allows untrusted users to trigger these tool calls. Some tool call paths allowed `gatewayUrl` overrides to flow into the Gateway WebSocket client without validation or allowlisting. This meant the host could be instructed to attempt connections to non-gateway endpoints (for example, localhost services, private network addresses, or cloud metadata IPs). In the common case, this results in an outbound connection attempt from the OpenClaw host (and corresponding errors/timeouts). In environments where the tool caller can observe the results, this can also be used for limited network reachability probing. If the target speaks WebSocket and is reachable, further interaction may be possible. Starting in version 2026.2.14, tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides are restricted to loopback (on the configured gateway port) or the configured `gateway.remote.url`.

TXT records are unauthenticated. Prior to version 2026.2.14, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative routing/pinning inputs. iOS and macOS used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`) and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL. iOS and Android allowed the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin. On a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection. As of time of publication, the iOS and Android apps are alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN. Version 2026.2.14 fixes the issue. Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV + A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints. Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override stored TLS pins. In iOS/Android, first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint shown; no silent TOFU) and discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only. In Android, hostname verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning).",

Versions 10.2.0 and below are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive * wildcards followed by a literal character that doesn't appear in the test string. Each * compiles to a separate [^/]*? regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits. The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of * characters. With N=15, a single minimatch() call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever. Any application that passes user-controlled strings to minimatch() as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This issue has been fixed in version 10.2.1.",

      "description": "uTLS is a fork of crypto/tls, created to customize ClientHello for fingerprinting resistance while still using it for the handshake. Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0 contain a fingerprint mismatch with Chrome when using GREASE ECH, related to cipher suite selection. When Chrome selects the preferred cipher suite in the outer ClientHello and for ECH, it does so consistently based on hardware support—for example, if it prefers AES for the outer cipher suite, it also uses AES for ECH. However, the Chrome parrot in uTLS hardcodes AES preference for outer cipher suites but selects the ECH cipher suite randomly between AES and ChaCha20. This creates a 50% chance of selecting ChaCha20 for ECH while using AES for the outer cipher suite, a combination impossible in Chrome. This issue only affects GREASE ECH; in real ECH, Chrome selects the first valid cipher suite when AES is preferred, which uTLS handles correctly. This issue has been fixed in version 1.8.1.",
